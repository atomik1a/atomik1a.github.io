Well. I did it. It took a ton of trial and error. But I did it. (I'm starting to see this as a pattern)

If you've read my homepage, you know that I enjoy learning and I took it this as a challenge that I wanted to conquer. It's not the prettiest blog, but it gets the job done for what I want it to do. 

Now, why did I bother going through the trouble of creating a blog with Hugo and deploying it on GitHub Pages? 

Your answer? I am easily influenced.. I was talking to some gray beards in a back-end development discord server (no idea how I ended up there, don't ask) and they were all hooting and hollering about the greatness of this technology, Hugo and the Go language in general. While I do agree it has a lot of upsides, it was quite the learning curve. There's too many ways to make a website!
